## Profile

I am a software developer with over 25 years of experience. I have expert level skills in the latest versions of Java and Spring Boot as well as some complimentary technologies such as Spring Security, Spring Cloud, Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, JPA, and relational databases. I have extensive experience in Keycloak / Red Hat SSO and the underlying OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

I worked in various roles  on Agile/Scrum projects including Software Architect, Senior Developer and Business Analyst. I have strong modelling and documentation skills. I am SAFe for Architects certified and dedicated to improving my skills to keep up to date with the latest technology trends. I also obtained a Capgemini Connected Manager certification and managed a total of seven consultants at Capgemini.

I started my career as a full stack [Active Server Pages (ASP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) Web Developer, where I was responsible for the full lifecycle of the software from business/requirements analysis, development and testing to production support. In 2002 when ASP.NET was released, I changed my career to specialise in business/requirements analysis for the next 9 years. During this time I mastered using [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) and [Use Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) for documenting requirements and clearly communicating between programmers and the business. In 2006, while still working as a Business Analyst, I started learning [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [Jakarta EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE). In 2012 I transitioned from Business Analysis to Java development on a project I started as the Lead Business Analyst. I have been working as Java programmer ever since. I have also fulfilled the role of team lead and Software Architect on a few projects.

From the start of my career I have worked in an agile way and had many successes on agile projects. I have encountered a number of teams along the way that struggled with agile adoption. This started a career long passion of mine to help teams be truly agile and to develop better quality software faster and cheaper.

I am passionate about User Stories, Domain Driven Design (DDD), Test Driven Development (TDD), Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Most of all I am passionate about good design. For me good design is rooted in simplicity. A design does not reach it's optimal state when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to remove.
